// This file contains regular expression patterns for words indicating future.
// FORMAT: one line is one disjunction of the pattern
// We have not a word which indicates the "future" tense, but
// the verb has another conjugation. For example: 
// The tags in tensePos4Future have to be matched for "future tense" and in addition
// the token with such a tag has to be included in tenseWord4Future:
[A-Z]?[a-z]+[eai]rei
[A-Z]?[a-z]+[eai]rás
[A-Z]?[a-z]+[eai]rá
[A-Z]?[a-z]+[eai]remos
[A-Z]?[a-z]+[eai]reis
[A-Z]?[a-z]+[eai]rão
