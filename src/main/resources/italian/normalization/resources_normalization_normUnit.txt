// This file contains "unit words" and their normalized expressions.
// For example, the normalized value of "week" is "week"
// FORMAT: "unit-word","normalized-unit-word"
// minute and hours are not in the pattern file 
// since they have to be normalized in another way than the other expressions
// but they are needed here
